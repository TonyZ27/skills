## 📖 Overview

**Tokens in Page** was born out of the need to manage large-scale Design Systems. As files grow, keeping track of Local, Linked, and Missing variables becomes a nightmare. This plugin provides a high-performance, structured way to audit your design assets and fix "design debt" in seconds.

Built with a **UX-first approach**, it focuses on helping Design System Leads and UX Engineers maintain a single source of truth.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Deep Scan:** Search across the `Entire File` or `Current Page` with high-performance layer traversal.
-   **Smart Filtering:** Filter by source (**Local**, **Linked**, or **Missing**) and layer types (Components, Frames, etc.).
-   **Structured Inventory:** Organize tokens by `Collection` and `Variable Group`. Items without a group are automatically categorized under **Global**.
-   **Visual Audit (Zoom-in):** Click any layer name to instantly jump to and zoom in on that specific node in the Figma canvas.
-   **Batch Actions:** Select multiple nodes to `Duplicate` or `Replace Variables` in one click, significantly reducing manual labor.
-   **Native Experience:** A UI designed to feel like a native part of the Figma interface, minimizing cognitive load.

## 📐 Design Philosophy

This plugin isn't just a tool; it's an extension of the **UX Engineering** mindset:
1.  **Transparency:** Clearly show where design debt exists.
2.  **Efficiency:** Batch operations are prioritized to avoid repetitive tasks.
3.  **Safety:** Prevent "blind" changes by providing visual context (Zoom-in) before modification.
